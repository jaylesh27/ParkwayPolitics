        "description": "The New Jersey state legislature was quite productive in late March so we go over some of the legislation being passed and being considered in Trenton. We go over the six gun laws passed in the State Assembly, some great pieces of legislation that came out of a Senate Committee that are focused on voting reforms, and the 'strongest equal pay law' that passed in both houses of the state legislature. We also have some quick 2018 election updates and we finish the episode with an interesting interview with one of the Democratic primary candidates in NJ's 7th Congressional District: Goutam Jois.",
